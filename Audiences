Potential audiences for the various radio projects:

- Experimental Physics Research Academy

4 - 7 high school rising juniors and seniors, 4 days, about 3 - 4
hours per day.  idea is to have some self-contained modules on radio
astronomy and astronomy that have a big hands-on component.

These students will typically have had at least one year of academic
physics, probably not calculus based, and probably not E&M or optics.
We can see what other projects they do on the web site:

Always good to have some sort of survey or other feedback at the end
to understand what they learned (what was new to you?) but also did
you like it?  What stuck in your mind?

July 17 - 20 the students will be around.

- Boys' Latin High School Students

Every other week for an hour during the school year I'm with them.

Good to have projects they can be doing in the meantime.

- ASTR250

about a dozen students 2nd - 4th year, some engineers, some physics
doing observational astronomy ("Astrophysical Techniques")
